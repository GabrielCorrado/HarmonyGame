# HarmonyGame
A puzzle game written in Processing.

I wrote this at the end of 2015 as a personal project. I wanted to get a better feel for how drawing a user interface might work in Processing, and I was interested in how easy a game like this could be implemented. I was fortunate that the graphics drawing was really simple; I didn't want to worry about game assets, so I made sure everything could be drawn with lines, rectangles, and text. This was fun, but not a great example of coding practices: I didn't plot out a design first, and a lot of the code is not very readable, particularly the level generator and the drawing of objects.
